## **Why is there a preview here?**
### (If you're visiting this from mdprev.surge.sh)

In case you're already viewing my project on surge you may be asking yourself: "Why the hell is there a preview of the _thing_ when I'm on the thing _already_ ?!". There's a perfectly straightforward answer to that: I was trying to automatically import the "readme.md" file that I use on github within the homepage of the project itself and I have apparently succeeded.

# **About the project**

This project is part of a series of projects I'm building by following the [freeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).

The [project](http://mdprev.surge.sh/) was uploaded to an amazing service called [*surge*](https://surge.sh/). I highly recommend checking it out.

As per usual I have tried to add a bit more functionality than simply meeting the requirements given by freeCodeCamp's [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). They may not be apparent features, but they are there! (just check the code for yourself ;) )

## **Motivation**
In this project I wanted to try and make optimal use of the React framework after learning about it for a week or so. It's pretty interesting so far.
