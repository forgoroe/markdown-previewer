# **markdown-previewer**
**Type markdown and get a live preview *as you type***.

This project is part of a series of projects I'm building by following the [freeCodeCamp course](https://www.freecodecamp.com/).

The [project](http://mdprev.surge.sh/) was uploaded to an amazing service called *surge*. I highly recommend checking [it](https://surge.sh/) out.

As per usual I have tried to add a bit more functionality than simply meeting the requirements given by freeCodeCamp's [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story). They may not be apparent features, but they are there! (just check the code for yourself ;) )

## Motivation
In this project I wanted to try and make optimal use of the React framework after learning about for a week or so. Pretty interesting so far.
